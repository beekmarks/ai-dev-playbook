# Instruction Hierarchy in the AI Dev Playbook

When working with AI agents, conflicting instructions may arise. The AI Dev Playbook follows a strict hierarchy to resolve these conflicts:

## Priority Levels (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Playbook Core Principles**
   - Defined in `ai-dev-playbook-spec.md`
   - Cannot be overridden
   - Examples: Security requirements, ethical guidelines, code quality standards

2. **Project-Specific Guidelines**
   - Defined in `.ai-dev/config/variables.json` and project documentation
   - Can override defaults but not core principles
   - Examples: Coding style, testing framework, documentation format

3. **Task-Specific Instructions**
   - Provided in the prompt when invoking an agent
   - Can override project defaults but not project guidelines or core principles
   - Examples: Feature requirements, implementation preferences

4. **Generated Artifacts**
   - Code, documentation, or plans generated by previous agents
   - Lowest priority, should be treated as suggestions
   - Examples: Generated plans, code snippets, test cases

## Conflict Resolution Examples

| Scenario | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| Task instructions request code without tests, but core principles require testing | Generate code WITH tests, citing the core principle |
| Project uses Jest, but task requests Mocha tests | Use Mocha for this specific task |
| Generated plan suggests a library that violates project guidelines | Modify the plan to use an approved library |
