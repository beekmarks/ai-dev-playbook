# **Spec-Driven Development with AI**

## **Introduction**

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is an approach that prioritizes creating detailed specifications and design documents *before* writing code. When combined with AI assistance, this methodology produces higher quality, more maintainable software than ad-hoc "vibe coding" approaches.

## **Core Principles**

1. **Plans as Primary Assets**: The specifications and implementation plans are your most valuable development artifactsâ€”more valuable than the code itself, which is often rewritten. A flawed plan leads to hundreds of lines of incorrect code; flawed research can lead to thousands.
2. **Specifications First, Code Second**: Create detailed requirements, design documents, and API contracts before implementation.
3. **Human-Centered Reviews**: Code reviews should prioritize reviewing the plan (which is shorter and easier to read) over reviewing hundreds of lines of AI-generated code.
4. **Living Documentation**: Keep specifications and code in sync throughout development.
5. **Test-Driven Approach**: Generate tests alongside or before code implementation.
6. **Structured Workflow**: Follow a consistent process from spec to implementation.

## **Benefits Over "Vibe Coding"**

| Aspect | "Vibe Coding" (Ad-hoc Prompting) | Spec-Driven Development |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Speed** | Fast for simple prototypes | More efficient for complex features |
| **Documentation** | Often minimal or missing | Built-in, comprehensive |
| **Maintainability** | Lower, decisions undocumented | Higher, design rationale preserved |
| **Testing** | Often an afterthought | Integrated from the beginning |
| **Team Collaboration** | Difficult to coordinate | Clear shared understanding |
| **Scaling** | Breaks down with complexity | Scales to enterprise applications |

## **Implementing Spec-Driven Development**

### 1. Create Specification Documents

Start by creating structured specification documents. You can choose either approach:

**Option A: Multiple Focused Files**

- `requirements.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, and constraints
- `design.md`: Architecture, data models, and component interactions
- `api-contract.md`: API endpoints, request/response formats

**Option B: Single Comprehensive File**

- `feature-spec.md`: A comprehensive document containing all specifications including requirements, design, API contracts, data models, and testing strategy

### 2. Generate Tasks from Specifications

Use the Planner Agent to break down specifications into discrete tasks:

```
Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, create a task list based on the specifications in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/feature-spec.md
```

### 3. Implement with Continuous Reference to Specs

When implementing code, always reference the specification documents:

```
Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement the API endpoint described in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/api-contract.md
```

### 4. Keep Documentation in Sync

Update specification documents when implementation details change:

```
Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/06-documenter-agent.md, update the design document at @workspace .ai-dev/memory/design.md to reflect the changes made to the authentication flow
```

## **Plan-Centric Code Reviews**

### **Why Review Plans Instead of Code**

Traditional code reviews of AI-generated code can be overwhelming and ineffective:
- **Volume Problem**: AI can generate hundreds of lines of code in minutes
- **Context Loss**: Reviewers often lack the context for why specific implementation choices were made  
- **Surface-Level Review**: Reviewers focus on syntax and style rather than architectural decisions

### **Plan Review Process**

1. **Review the Specification**: Start with the spec document to understand the requirements and design decisions
2. **Examine the Plan**: Review the implementation plan in `AIDEV.md` or `.ai-dev/memory/` files
3. **Validate Architecture**: Ensure the planned approach aligns with system architecture
4. **Check Completeness**: Verify all requirements are addressed in the plan
5. **Light Code Review**: Do a high-level code review focused on:
   - Plan adherence (does the code match the plan?)
   - Integration points
   - Security considerations
   - Error handling patterns

### **Review Checklist**

**Plan Quality:**
- [ ] Does the plan clearly address all requirements?
- [ ] Are architectural decisions documented with rationale?
- [ ] Are dependencies and integration points identified?
- [ ] Does the plan include testing strategy?

**Implementation Alignment:**
- [ ] Does the code follow the approved plan?
- [ ] Are deviations from the plan documented and justified?
- [ ] Do tests match the planned testing strategy?

**AIDEV.md Quality:**
- [ ] Is the feature properly documented in the project ledger?
- [ ] Are design decisions and trade-offs captured?
- [ ] Will future developers understand the "why" behind this implementation?

## **Integration with AI Dev Playbook Workflow**

The spec-driven approach enhances the existing AI Dev Playbook workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**: Create detailed specifications before generating the implementation plan
2. **Estimation Phase**: More accurate estimates based on detailed specifications
3. **Execution Phase**: Implementation guided by specifications
4. **Quality Phase**: Verification against specifications
5. **Archival Phase**: Specifications included in the project ledger

By adopting spec-driven development, teams can leverage AI assistance while maintaining software engineering best practices and creating more maintainable, well-documented code.
