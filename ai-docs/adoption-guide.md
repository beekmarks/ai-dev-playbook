# **AI Dev Playbook: Adoption Guide**

This guide explains how to adopt the AI Dev Playbook workflow for both new (Greenfield) and existing (Brownfield) projects. The core principle in both scenarios is maintaining a logical separation between your application code and the AI Dev Playbook framework.

## **The Separation Principle**

The AI Dev Playbook assets (.ai-dev/, .github/prompts/, AIDEV.md, docs/) are **development-time tools**, not production code. They are meta-artifacts that help you write, test, and document your code, but they are never deployed.

* **Your Application Code (/src, /app, etc.):** This is the code that gets built, tested in CI/CD, and deployed. It is the product.  
* **The AI Dev Playbook Framework (.ai-dev/ and .github/):** This is the set of "recipes" and processes you use to create the product. It should never be bundled in your final build.

## **Use Case 1: New Greenfield Projects**

For new applications, the process is simple as you are starting with a clean slate.

1. **Use as a Template:** Clone or generate your new repository from the ai-dev-playbook-starter template. This provides you with the complete, correct structure from day one.  
2. **Develop in /src:** Begin developing your application code inside the src/ directory. You can rename or restructure this as needed (e.g., to /lib, /app), but all of your application-specific logic should reside there.  
3. **Follow the Workflow:** For every new feature or task, follow the workflow outlined in docs/ai-dev-playbook-workflow.md. The framework assets in .ai-dev/ are already in place to support you.
4. **Choose Your Integration Style:** Decide whether to use the traditional workflow with agent templates, the GitHub Copilot native integration, or both approaches in parallel.
5. **Choose Your Development Approach:** Decide whether to use "Vibe Coding" for quick prototyping or "Spec-Driven Development" for complex features requiring detailed specifications before implementation. See [spec-driven-development.md](spec-driven-development.md) for details.

The logical separation is maintained by default. The framework guides the creation of your code but remains distinct from it.

## **Use Case 2: Existing Brownfield Projects**

Integrating the AI Dev Playbook into a mature codebase requires a simple "drop-in" process without disrupting existing code.

1. **Copy Framework Files:** Copy the following files and directories from the starter repo into the **root directory** of your existing project:  
   * The entire .ai-dev/ directory.  
   * The .github/copilot-instructions.md file and .github/prompts/ directory.  
   * The AIDEV.md file.  
   * The docs/ directory (or just docs/ai-dev-playbook-workflow.md, docs/github-copilot-integration.md, and this docs/adoption-guide.md).  
2. **No Code Changes Required:** This action should require **zero modifications** to your existing application source code. The AI Dev Playbook assets will sit alongside your current /src, /app, /tests directories.  
3. **(Optional) Tune the Prompts and Instructions:** Your team should take a few minutes to tune both the agent prompts and GitHub Copilot instructions to your project's specific context:
   * For agent templates: Add project-specific context to files in `.ai-dev/prompts/`. For example, you might add a line to 03-coder-agent.md like: *"This is a Java Spring Boot application using Maven. Ensure all code follows standard Java 17 conventions and our internal style guide."*
   * For GitHub Copilot: Customize `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with your project's coding standards, architecture, and other important context. Also review and update the prompt files in `.github/prompts/` to align with your team's needs.
   * Consider using template variables in `.ai-dev/config/variables.json` to maintain consistency across both systems.  
4. **Initialize AIDEV.md:** You do not need to retroactively document your entire project. Instead, create an initial entry in AIDEV.md to mark the start of the new process.  
   \#\# Process Adopted \- July 08, 2025

   \#\#\# Description  
   The AI Dev Playbook development workflow was officially adopted for this project. All new features and significant bug fixes will be logged in this document going forward.

5. **Start with New Work:** From this point forward, your team follows the AI Dev Playbook workflow for all new development. The framework is now a part of your development process, and the AIDEV.md ledger will grow over time, increasing the project's maintainability.

## **Choosing Your Integration Approach**

The AI Dev Playbook now offers two complementary approaches to AI-assisted development. Here's guidance on when to use each:

### **Traditional Workflow with Agent Templates**

**Best for:**
- Teams new to AI-assisted development who benefit from the structured workflow
- Complex features that require multiple specialized agents (planning, estimation, coding, testing)
- Projects where maintaining a comprehensive development history in AIDEV.md is critical
- Teams who want maximum control over AI interactions

**How to use:** Follow the workflow in ai-dev-playbook-workflow.md, using `@workspace` commands to invoke agent templates.

### **GitHub Copilot Native Integration**

**Best for:**
- Teams already familiar with GitHub Copilot Chat
- Quick, focused tasks that don't require the full workflow
- Developers who prefer a more conversational AI interaction
- Onboarding new team members to the AI Dev Playbook methodology

**How to use:** Use GitHub Copilot Chat with the `@prompt` command to access prompt files, or simply benefit from the repository custom instructions during normal Copilot interactions.

### **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

Many teams will benefit from using both approaches in parallel:

1. Use the **traditional workflow** for complex features, major refactorings, and significant changes
2. Use the **Copilot native integration** for quick tasks, bug fixes, and exploratory work

Both approaches complement each other and reinforce the same development principles and standards.

## **Implementing Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Safeguards**

Regardless of which integration approach you choose, implementing structured HITL safeguards is essential for successful AI-assisted development:

### **Getting Started with HITL**

1. **Review the Governance Guide**: Familiarize your team with the HITL patterns described in the governance-and-sustainability.md document.

2. **Select Appropriate HITL Patterns**: Based on your project's risk profile and team structure, decide which HITL patterns to implement:
   - **Approval-Based HITL**: Required for all teams, especially for critical code
   - **Audit Trail HITL**: Recommended for regulatory compliance or when training new team members
   - **Expert-in-the-Loop HITL**: Valuable for complex domains with specialized knowledge requirements

3. **Identify Never-Automate Zones**: Document in AIDEV.md which parts of your codebase should never be modified by AI without extensive human oversight:
   - Security mechanisms
   - Regulatory compliance code
   - Critical business logic
   - Financial calculations

4. **Establish Approval Workflows**: Create PR templates and review checklists specific to AI-assisted code changes.

5. **Set Up Observability**: Implement a system for logging AI interactions and capturing feedback on AI-generated code quality.

HITL safeguards should evolve with your team's experience with AI-assisted development. Start with more oversight and gradually adjust as your team builds confidence in the process.

## **Repository Structure Considerations**

The placement of the AI Dev Playbook assets depends on your repository structure.

### **Stand-Alone Repositories**

For a standard repository that contains a single application or library, the placement is simple:

* The .ai-dev directory, .github directory (with copilot-instructions.md and prompts/), AIDEV.md, and docs directory should live at the **root of the repository**.

This top-level placement signifies that the framework governs the single project contained within the repo.

### **Nx Monorepos**

In a monorepo, a single root-level framework is not ideal, as it would mix the history and context of many different, independent projects.

**The recommended approach is to treat each application or library within the monorepo as its own "project" deserving of its own AI Dev Playbook instance.**

* **Placement:** 
  * The `.ai-dev` directory and the `AIDEV.md` file should be placed **inside each project's directory**.
  * For GitHub Copilot integration, you have two options:
    * **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Place project-specific `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/prompts/` in each project directory
    * **Option 2**: Use a single repository-level `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with sections for each project
* **Why:**  
  * **Scoped AIDEV.md:** This keeps the development ledger clean and relevant to the specific project (apps/web-app has its own history, separate from libs/auth-lib).  
  * **Tuned Prompts:** This allows the prompts for each project to be tuned to its specific technology stack (e.g., React prompts for the web app, NestJS prompts for the API).
  * **Project-Specific Variables:** Use `.ai-dev/config/variables.json` in each project to customize template variables for that project's specific needs.
