# **AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)**

This document is a chronological log of all significant development tasks performed with the assistance of an AI. It serves as the official, evolving history of the project, providing context on the "why" and "how" behind the codebase.

Each entry is generated by the Archiver agent and includes the plan, key code artifacts, and other relevant details for a given feature or fix. This file should be committed to version control with every completed task.

## **Feature: Initial Project Setup \- July 07, 2025**

### **Description**

This initial entry documents the setup of the AI Dev Playbook starter repository itself, including the creation of the core prompt agents and this AIDEV.md file.

### **Plan**

1. Define the core principles of the AI Dev Playbook workflow, including specialized agents, workspace context, and a permanent development log.  
2. Create the repository file structure (/.ai-dev, /docs, /src).  
3. Draft the initial versions of all agent prompts:  
   * 00-specification-agent.md
   * 01-planner-agent.md  
   * 02-estimator-agent.md
   * 03-coder-agent.md  
   * 04-tester-agent.md  
   * 05-refactor-agent.md  
   * 06-documenter-agent.md  
   * 07-security-reviewer-agent.md  
   * 08-archiver-agent.md
   * **Phase 3 Additions:**
   * 00-delegator-agent.md (Meta-orchestrator for agent swarm)
   * 09-code-review-agent.md (AI-powered code analysis)  
4. Create this AIDEV.md file with a sample entry documenting its own creation.  
5. Add a README.md and detailed guides in the docs/ directory to explain the project and workflow.

## **Feature: Phase 3 - Advanced AI Agent Orchestration & Code Review - August 12, 2025**

2. Create orchestration infrastructure script for agent coordination and workflow management
3. Develop comprehensive documentation and usage guides
4. Test orchestration capabilities with real-world scenarios

**Phase 3.2: AI-Powered Code Review Integration**
1. Design AI-Powered Code Review Agent with multi-dimensional analysis capabilities
2. Implement automation script with Git integration and CI/CD support
3. Create comprehensive documentation for intelligent code review processes
4. Test review automation with various code change scenarios
