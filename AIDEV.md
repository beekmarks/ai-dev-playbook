# **AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)**

This document is a chronological log of all significant development tasks performed with the assistance of an AI. It serves as the official, evolving history of the project, providing context on the "why" and "how" behind the codebase.

Each entry is generated by the Archiver agent and includes the plan, key code artifacts, and other relevant details for a given feature or fix. This file should be committed to version control with every completed task.

## **Feature: Initial Project Setup \- July 07, 2025**

### **Description**

This initial entry documents the setup of the AI Dev Playbook starter repository itself, including the creation of the core prompt agents and this AIDEV.md file.

### **Plan**

1. Define the core principles of the AI Dev Playbook workflow, including specialized agents, workspace context, and a permanent development log.  
2. Create the repository file structure (/.ai-dev, /docs, /src).  
3. Draft the initial versions of all seven agent prompts:  
   * 01-planner-agent.md  
   * 02-coder-agent.md  
   * 03-tester-agent.md  
   * 04-refactor-agent.md  
   * 05-documenter-agent.md  
   * 06-security-reviewer-agent.md  
   * 07-archiver-agent.md  
4. Create this AIDEV.md file with a sample entry documenting its own creation.  
5. Add a README.md and detailed guides in the docs/ directory to explain the project and workflow.
