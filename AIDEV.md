# **AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)**

This document is a chronological log of all significant development tasks performed with the assistance of an AI. It serves as the official, evolving history of the project, providing context on the "why" and "how" behind the codebase.

Each entry is generated by the Archiver agent and includes the plan, key code artifacts, and other relevant details for a given feature or fix. This file should be committed to version control with every completed task.

## **Feature: Initial Project Setup \- July 07, 2025**

### **Description**

This initial entry documents the setup of the AI Dev Playbook starter repository itself, including the creation of the core prompt agents and this AIDEV.md file.

### **Plan**

1. Define the core principles of the AI Dev Playbook workflow, including specialized agents, workspace context, and a permanent development log.  
2. Create the repository file structure (/.ai-dev, /docs, /src).  
3. Draft the initial versions of all agent prompts:  
   * 00-specification-agent.md
   * 01-planner-agent.md  
   * 02-estimator-agent.md
   * 03-coder-agent.md  
   * 04-tester-agent.md  
   * 05-refactor-agent.md  
   * 06-documenter-agent.md  
   * 07-security-reviewer-agent.md  
   * 08-archiver-agent.md
   * **Advanced Additions:**
   * 00-delegator-agent.md (Meta-orchestrator for agent swarm)
   * 09-code-review-agent.md (AI-powered code analysis)  
4. Create this AIDEV.md file with a sample entry documenting its own creation.  
5. Add a README.md and detailed guides in the docs/ directory to explain the project and workflow.

## **Feature: Advanced Agent Orchestration and Code Review Integration (2024-12-XX)**

**Objective**: Implement Delegator Agent for meta-agent orchestration and integrate AI-powered code review system to enable autonomous goal-oriented development with comprehensive quality assurance.

**Architecture Transformation**: Evolved from individual agent coordination to sophisticated agent swarm architecture with meta-agent orchestration, enabling Level 3 (goal-oriented) autonomous development capabilities.

**Security Foundation**: All implementations built on secure sandbox execution architecture that separates AI agent execution (with model access) from code execution (in isolated Docker environments). See [Secure Sandbox Execution Guide](docs/secure-sandbox-execution.md) for complete details.

### **Strategic Plan**

**Delegator Agent Orchestration**
1. Design and implement Delegator Agent as meta-orchestrator for specialized agent swarm
2. Create orchestration infrastructure script for agent coordination and workflow management
3. Develop comprehensive documentation and usage guides
4. Test orchestration capabilities with real-world scenarios

**AI-Powered Code Review Integration**
1. Design AI-Powered Code Review Agent with multi-dimensional analysis capabilities
2. Implement automation script with Git integration and CI/CD support
3. Create comprehensive documentation for intelligent code review processes
4. Test review automation with various code change scenarios

### **Key Capabilities Unlocked**

1. **Meta-Agent Orchestration**: Delegator Agent coordinates 10 specialized agents across Planning, Execution, and Quality clusters
2. **Autonomous Goal Decomposition**: Complex objectives automatically broken down into actionable plans with human strategic oversight
3. **AI-Powered Code Review**: Multi-dimensional analysis covering quality, security, performance, and documentation with automated CI/CD integration
4. **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Secure sandbox execution with Docker isolation, comprehensive audit trails, and advanced HITL governance patterns
5. **Scalable Agent Swarm**: Modular architecture supporting parallel agent execution and intelligent coordination
6. **Secure Sandbox Architecture**: Complete separation of AI agent execution (host with model access) from code execution (isolated containers)

### **Key Artifacts Created**

- `docs/ai-code-review-guide.md` - Comprehensive code review implementation guide

### **Architecture Transformation**

**Agent Swarm Structure:**
```
Planning Cluster:     Execution Cluster:     Quality Cluster:
├─ Specification     ├─ Coder               ├─ Security Reviewer
├─ Planner           ├─ Refactorer          ├─ Documenter  
└─ Estimator         └─ Tester              └─ AIDEV Archiver
                            ↑
                    Delegator Agent
                   (Meta-Orchestrator)
                            ↓
                   AI Code Review Agent
                  (Quality Intelligence)
```
