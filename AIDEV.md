# **AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)**

This document is a chronological log of all significant development tasks performed with the assistance of an AI. It serves as the official, evolving history of the project, providing context on the "why" and "how" behind the codebase.

Each entry is generated by the Archiver agent and includes the plan, key code artifacts, and other relevant details for a given feature or fix. This file should be committed to version control with every completed task.

## **Feature: Initial Project Setup \- July 07, 2025**

### **Description**

This initial entry documents the setup of the AI Dev Playbook starter repository itself, including the creation of the core prompt agents and this AIDEV.md file.

### **Plan**

1. Define the core principles of the AI Dev Playbook workflow, including specialized agents, workspace context, and a permanent development log.  
2. Create the repository file structure (/.ai-dev, /docs, /src).  
3. Draft the initial versions of all agent prompts:  
   * 00-specification-agent.md
   * 01-planner-agent.md  
   * 02-estimator-agent.md  
   * 03-coder-agent.md  
   * 04-tester-agent.md  
   * 05-refactor-agent.md  
   * 06-documenter-agent.md  
   * 07-security-reviewer-agent.md  
   * 08-archiver-agent.md  
4. Create this AIDEV.md file with a sample entry documenting its own creation.  
5. Add a README.md and detailed guides in the docs/ directory to explain the project and workflow.

## **Enhancement: OpenAI Model Spec Integration \- August 02, 2025**

### **Description**

This entry documents the comprehensive enhancement of the AI Dev Playbook through the integration of OpenAI Model Spec principles, focusing on structured agent templates with explicit Objectives-Rules-Defaults sections, specialized agent variants, and improved documentation.

### **Plan**

1. Review OpenAI Model Spec principles and identify applications to the AI Dev Playbook
2. Draft proposals for new/augmented playbook sections based on recommendations
3. Create ai-docs/future-considerations.md to capture all proposals for future consideration
4. Implement suggested enhancements in the codebase:
   * Update agent templates to Objectives-Rules-Defaults structure
   * Create new documentation files
   * Update template variables with enhanced settings
   * Create specialized agent variants

### **Implementation Details**

#### **Agent Template Updates**

All agent templates were restructured to follow the OpenAI Model Spec principles with:

* **OBJECTIVES** section: Clear statements of what the agent aims to accomplish
* **RULES** section: Strict always/never statements to guide behavior
* **DEFAULTS** section: Sensible defaults for when specific instructions aren't provided

Example from the Tester Agent:
```markdown
# **OBJECTIVES**
- Write comprehensive tests for a given piece of code to ensure it is correct, robust, and reliable
- Achieve high test coverage for critical functionality
- Identify potential edge cases and failure points
- Ensure tests are maintainable and follow project conventions

# **RULES**
- Never modify the source code being tested
- Always test happy paths, edge cases, and error handling
- Never skip testing critical functionality
- Always follow the project's testing conventions
- Never write tests that depend on external services unless explicitly instructed
```

#### **New Documentation**

Created several new documentation files to support the enhanced playbook:

* **ai-docs/ai-dev-playbook-spec.md**: Formal specification defining core principles
* **ai-docs/instruction-hierarchy.md**: Priority levels for resolving conflicting instructions
* **ai-docs/collaborative-development.md**: Guidelines for human-AI collaboration
* **ai-docs/agent-selection-guide.md**: Decision tree for choosing appropriate agents
* **ai-docs/refusal-guidelines.md**: When and how AI agents should refuse requests
* **ai-docs/uncertainty-guidelines.md**: Handling uncertainty in AI recommendations
* **ai-docs/ai-readable-documentation.md**: Best practices for AI-readable docs

#### **Template Variables Enhancement**

Expanded the template variables system to include behavioral settings:

* **Verbosity level**: Controls detail in explanations (minimal, balanced, detailed)
* **Code generation style**: Amount of code to generate (minimal, conservative, comprehensive)
* **Explanation detail**: Depth of design decision explanations (low, medium, high)

#### **Specialized Agent Variants**

Created specialized variants of the Coder Agent in ai-dev/prompts/variants/:

* **Interactive Coder Agent**: Provides detailed explanations and educational context
* **Automated Coder Agent**: Focuses on minimal, production-ready code for CI/CD pipelines
* **Review Coder Agent**: Provides constructive code review feedback

### **Design Decisions**

1. **Technology Agnosticism**: Maintained the playbook's independence from specific tools or platforms
2. **Instruction Hierarchy**: Created a clear priority system to resolve conflicting instructions
3. **Structured Templates**: Adopted Objectives-Rules-Defaults structure for clarity and consistency
4. **Template Variables**: Enhanced customization options without modifying core templates

### **Future Considerations**

Documented additional enhancement ideas in ai-docs/future-considerations.md for potential future implementation.
