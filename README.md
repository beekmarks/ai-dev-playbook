# **AI Dev Playbook Starter Repository**

Welcome\! This repository is a template for building software using a structured, repeatable, and high-quality **AI-Assisted Development** methodology. It's designed for teams using GitHub Copilot within VS Code.

The goal of this "AI Dev Playbook" is not to replace developer thinking, but to augment it. By providing a standardized set of tools (prompts) and a clear process, we can leverage AI to handle routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on architecture and complex problem-solving. This leads to faster development, higher quality code, and a fully documented project history.


## **Core Concepts**

This workflow is built on a few key ideas:

| Concept | Implementation | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Developer as Director** | Your role in the VS Code Chat | You are in control. You direct the AI, providing it with context and instructions, and you are the final arbiter of quality. In the agentic era, this evolves into **Strategic Direction** - setting clear objectives, constraints, and success criteria through advanced **Defensive Prompting** techniques. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** | Enhanced approval workflows | Structured patterns for human oversight including Strategic Validation, Human-on-the-Loop supervision, and comprehensive audit trails. Essential for managing autonomous agents safely. |
| **Spec-Driven Development** | Specifications before code | Create detailed specifications (requirements, design, API contracts) before implementation for better quality and maintainability. |
| **Specialized Agent Swarm** | .ai-dev/prompts/ | A collection of 10 specialized prompt templates orchestrated by the **Delegator Agent** for autonomous goal-oriented development. Includes planning cluster, execution cluster, and quality cluster agents. |
| **GitHub Copilot Integration** | .github/ directory | Repository custom instructions and prompt files that provide the same guidance through native GitHub Copilot features. |
| **Workspace Context** | @workspace command | GitHub Copilot can read files directly from your workspace. You use this to provide context like requirements, existing code, or plans. |
| **Modular Memory** | .ai-dev/memory/ | A transient "scratchpad." The output of one agent (e.g., a plan) is saved here to be used as the input for the next agent, creating a clean chain of operations. Note the dot prefix: this is a hidden directory separate from ai-dev/prompts/ to ensure generated files are not committed. |
| **Permanent Log (AIDEV.md)** | **The Project's Memory & Explanation Log** | **Why this exists:** While Git history tells you *what* changed line-by-line, AIDEV.md tells you *why*. It's a human-readable ledger of all work completed, capturing the high-level plan and intent behind each feature. **Evolution**: Now serves as an automated **Explanation Log** that can be synthesized from structured Git commit history, dramatically reducing manual overhead while improving audit quality. |
| **Minimal Code Generation** | Enforced in Agent Prompts | **The AI should write as little code as possible.** It should only generate the minimum code necessary to implement the requested feature. This prevents code bloat and keeps commits small, focused, and easy to review. |

## **Multi-Modal Interaction Framework**

The AI Dev Playbook supports three distinct interaction modes, each optimized for different scales of work:

### **üî¨ Micro-Workflow (Cursor-Style)**

- Use the Integration Assistant instead of manual copying
- Check file permissions and directory structure
- Ensure you're running commands from the correct directory

**Prompts Not Customized?**
- The Integration Assistant automatically customizes prompts with real project context
- Manual setup requires editing `.ai-dev/config/variables.json` and prompt files
- Remove placeholder values like `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with actual values

## **The Workflow: A Real-World Example**

Let's walk through adding a new feature: **"Create a new API endpoint /api/items that returns a list of items."**

### **Step 1: Create Specifications**

First, we ask the **Specification Developer Agent** to create detailed specifications for the feature. You can request either a single comprehensive specification file or multiple focused files.

**Option A: Single Specification File:**

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using the agent at @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/00-specification-agent.md, create a comprehensive specification for a new API endpoint /api/items. The endpoint should fetch data from itemService.js and return it as JSON. Include requirements, design, API contract, and testing strategy. Save the output to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-spec.md."

**Option B: Multiple Specification Files:**

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using the agent at @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/00-specification-agent.md, create separate specification files for a new API endpoint /api/items. The endpoint should fetch data from itemService.js and return it as JSON. Create requirements.md, design.md, and api-contract.md files in the .ai-dev/memory/ directory."

### **Step 2: Plan the Work**

Next, we ask the **Planner Agent** to break down the task based on our specifications. We give it the specifications and tell it where to save the output.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using the agent at @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, create a plan to implement the API endpoint based on the specifications in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-spec.md. Save the output to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-plan.md."

### **Step 3: Estimate the Work**

Before implementation, we use the **Estimator Agent** to get time and complexity estimates for our plan.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/02-estimator-agent.md, provide time and complexity estimates for the plan in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-plan.md. Save the output to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-estimates.md."

### **Step 4: Write the Code**

Now, we execute the plan step-by-step using the **Coder Agent**.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Step 1 from the plan in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-plan.md."

### **Step 5: Write the Tests**

With the code written, we ask the **Tester Agent** to create the tests.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/04-tester-agent.md, write unit tests for the new getItems function in @workspace src/services/itemService.js. Ensure you test the happy path and that it returns an array."

### **Step 6: Review and Refine**

Before finishing, we can use other agents like the **Security Reviewer** or **Refactorer** to ensure quality.

### **Step 7: Update Specifications**

If implementation details changed during development, we update our specifications to keep them in sync with the code.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/06-documenter-agent.md, update the specifications in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-spec.md to reflect any changes made during implementation."

### **Step 8: Archive the History**

The feature is complete\! The final step is to use the **Archiver Agent** to create a permanent record in AIDEV.md.

**Your Chat Prompt:**

"Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/08-archiver-agent.md, create a new entry in @workspace AIDEV.md titled 'Feature: Add /api/items Endpoint'. Compile the plan from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/get-items-plan.md into it."

## **Governance and Best Practices**

* **Prompts are Curated:** The agent prompts in .ai-dev/prompts are the team's standard. Do not commit changes to them directly. If you discover a generally useful improvement, open a Pull Request to discuss it.  
* **AIDEV.md is the Project's Ledger:** This file is the project's long-term memory. The final step of every task is to append its story (plan, etc.) to this ledger. This ensures the "why" behind your code is preserved for future developers. You must include the updated AIDEV.md in your feature's Pull Request and be prepared to resolve merge conflicts.  
* **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING:** **NEVER** paste secrets, credentials, or sensitive customer data into a prompt. The AI is a third-party service. Use placeholders and reference environment variables, just as you would in your code.

## **Two Ways to Use the AI Dev Playbook**

The AI Dev Playbook now offers two complementary approaches to AI-assisted development:

### 1. Traditional Workflow with Agent Templates

Use the `@workspace` command with agent templates in `.ai-dev/prompts/` for a structured, full-featured workflow:

```
Using @workspace .ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, create a plan for...
```

This approach is ideal for complex features and teams following the complete methodology.

### 2. GitHub Copilot Native Integration

Use GitHub Copilot's built-in features with our custom instructions and prompt files:

- **Repository Custom Instructions**: Automatic guidance for all Copilot interactions
- **Prompt Files**: Quick access to agent capabilities via `@prompt` command

```
@prompt plan-feature
```

This approach is ideal for quick tasks and teams already familiar with Copilot Chat.

For more details on the GitHub Copilot integration, see [ai-docs/github-copilot-integration.md](ai-docs/github-copilot-integration.md).
