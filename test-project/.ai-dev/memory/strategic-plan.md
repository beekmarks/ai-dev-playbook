## Architecture Design

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input validation
- **Testing**: Jest + Supertest + security testing
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/auth/register     - User registration
POST /api/auth/login        - User authentication
GET  /api/auth/profile      - Get user profile
POST /api/tasks             - Create task
GET  /api/tasks             - List user tasks
GET  /api/tasks/:id         - Get specific task
PUT  /api/tasks/:id         - Update task
DELETE /api/tasks/:id       - Delete task
```

### Database Schema
```sql
Users: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
Tasks: id, user_id, title, description, status, priority, due_date, created_at, updated_at
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Planning Cluster)
**Agents**: Specification → Planner → Estimator

1. **Specification Agent**: Detailed requirements analysis
   - API specification with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Security requirements documentation
   - Database schema design
   - Error handling specifications

2. **Planner Agent**: Technical implementation plan
   - Project structure and file organization
   - Development sequence and dependencies
   - Integration points and interfaces
   - Configuration management

3. **Estimator Agent**: Effort and complexity assessment
   - Task complexity analysis
   - Time estimates per component
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Resource requirements

### Phase 2: Core Development (Execution Cluster)
**Agents**: Coder → Tester → Refactorer

4. **Coder Agent**: Implementation
   - Database connection and models
   - Authentication middleware and routes
   - Task CRUD operations
   - Error handling and logging
   - Security middleware integration

5. **Tester Agent**: Quality assurance
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Security tests for authentication/authorization
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Performance and load testing

6. **Refactorer Agent**: Code optimization
   - Code quality improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Security hardening
   - Documentation enhancements

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Quality Cluster)
**Agents**: Security Reviewer → Documenter → AIDEV Archiver

7. **Security Reviewer Agent**: Security analysis
   - Static security analysis
   - Dynamic security testing
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Security best practices validation
   - Compliance verification

8. **Documenter Agent**: Documentation
   - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Setup and deployment guide
   - Usage examples and tutorials
   - Security considerations
   - Troubleshooting guide

9. **AIDEV Archiver Agent**: Knowledge capture
   - AIDEV.md synthesis and updates
   - Development decision documentation
   - Lessons learned capture
   - Audit trail maintenance

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- User session management

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Request payload validation with Joi
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

### Security Headers & Middleware
- Helmet.js for security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Request logging and monitoring

### Secure Sandbox Execution
- All code execution in isolated Docker containers
- Network isolation preventing external access
- Resource limits and constraints
- Automated security testing in sandbox

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmarking

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code style and quality
- Automated code review with AI analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance profiling and optimization

### Documentation Standards
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Code comments and inline documentation
- Setup and deployment instructions
- Security considerations and best practices

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by comprehensive security testing
2. **Performance Issues**: Addressed through load testing and optimization
3. **Integration Complexity**: Managed through phased development approach
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Prevented by dedicated documentation agent

### Mitigation Strategies
