## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Security Implementation (Risk Level: High)
- **JWT Token Management**: Complex token validation and refresh logic
- **Password Security**: Proper bcrypt implementation and validation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation against injection attacks
- **Mitigation**: Allocate extra time for security review and testing

#### 2. Database Integration (Risk Level: Medium)
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL connection management
- **Transaction Handling**: Proper ACID compliance for data operations
- **Migration Management**: Database schema evolution and rollback
- **Mitigation**: Use established patterns and thorough testing

#### 3. Testing Complexity (Risk Level: Medium)
- **Security Testing**: Complex attack simulation and validation
- **Integration Testing**: Multi-component interaction testing
- **Sandbox Environment**: Docker-based testing environment setup
- **Mitigation**: Incremental testing approach with early validation

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 1. Authentication Flow (Risk Level: Medium)
- **JWT Implementation**: Token generation, validation, and expiration
- **User Session Management**: Proper session handling and security
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and logging

#### 2. API Design Consistency (Risk Level: Medium)
- **Response Format Standardization**: Consistent API response structure
- **Error Code Management**: Comprehensive error handling system
- **Validation Schema**: Input validation across all endpoints

### Low-Risk Areas

#### 1. Basic CRUD Operations (Risk Level: Low)
- **Standard Database Operations**: Well-established patterns
- **Route Configuration**: Straightforward Express.js implementation
- **Basic Validation**: Standard input validation patterns

## Confidence Analysis

### High Confidence Estimates (±10%)
- Environment configuration and setup
- Basic CRUD operations implementation
- Route configuration and middleware setup
- Standard utility function development

### Medium Confidence Estimates (±25%)
- Authentication middleware implementation
- Database integration and transaction handling
- Integration testing with multiple components
- Security middleware configuration

### Low Confidence Estimates (±50%)
- Comprehensive security testing
- Performance optimization requirements
- Complex error handling edge cases
- Production deployment considerations

## Critical Path Analysis

### Sequential Dependencies
1. **Foundation → Authentication**: Database and utilities must be complete before auth
2. **Authentication → Task Management**: User system required for task ownership
3. **Core Features → Testing**: Implementation must be complete before comprehensive testing

### Parallel Opportunities
- Unit tests can be developed alongside implementation
- Documentation can be written during development phases
- Environment configuration can be done in parallel with planning

### Bottlenecks
- **Security Implementation**: Complex and time-consuming, affects multiple components
- **Integration Testing**: Requires all components to be functional
- **Database Setup**: Foundation for all data operations

## Overall Project Timeline

### Summary Estimates
