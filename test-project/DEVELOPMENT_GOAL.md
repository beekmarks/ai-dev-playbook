# AI Dev Playbook v2.0 End-to-End Test: Task Management API

## High-Level Goal
**"Build a secure, production-ready Task Management API with user authentication, comprehensive testing, and enterprise-grade security"**

## Objective
This goal will test all AI Dev Playbook v2.0 capabilities:

### 🤖 **Delegator Agent Orchestration**
- Complex goal decomposition into actionable tasks
- Coordination of 10 specialized agents across Planning, Execution, and Quality clusters
- Strategic planning with human oversight checkpoints

### 🔒 **Secure Sandbox Execution**
- All code execution in isolated Docker containers
- Network isolation preventing external access
- Resource limits and security constraints enforced

### 🔍 **AI-Powered Code Review**
- Multi-dimensional code analysis (quality, security, performance)
- Automated security vulnerability detection
- Integration with Git workflow and CI/CD patterns

### 📊 **Agent Swarm Coordination**
- **Planning Cluster**: Specification → Planner → Estimator
- **Execution Cluster**: Coder → Refactorer → Tester  
- **Quality Cluster**: Security Reviewer → Documenter → AIDEV Archiver

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. **API Implementation**
- User registration and authentication (JWT)
- Task CRUD operations with proper validation
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Error handling and logging
- API rate limiting and security headers

### 2. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security tests for authentication/authorization
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for scalability

### 3. **Security Implementation**
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure password hashing
- HTTPS/TLS configuration
- Security headers and CORS

### 4. **Documentation**
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- README with setup instructions
- API usage examples
- Security considerations
- Deployment guide

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Code review with security analysis
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Automated quality gates
- Compliance validation
- Audit trail documentation

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Initialize Delegator Agent** with this high-level goal
2. **Agent Swarm Planning** - decompose goal into actionable tasks
3. **Secure Implementation** - all code execution in sandbox
4. **Continuous Review** - AI-powered analysis throughout development
5. **Quality Validation** - comprehensive testing and security review
6. **Documentation Synthesis** - automated AIDEV.md updates
7. **Final Assessment** - validate all success criteria met

This end-to-end test will demonstrate that AI Dev Playbook v2.0 can handle real-world enterprise development scenarios with autonomous intelligence, secure execution, and comprehensive quality assurance.
