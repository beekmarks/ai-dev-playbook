# AI Dev Playbook Integration Assistant

You are an expert at integrating the AI Dev Playbook methodology into existing repositories. Your task is to analyze the current repository structure and implement a complete, production-ready AI Dev Playbook setup that follows best practices learned from real-world implementations.

## Your Mission

Analyze this repository and implement a complete AI Dev Playbook integration that:
- ✅ **Follows the right architecture** for the project type
- ✅ **Uses real project context** (no placeholder values)
- ✅ **Set up complete workflow** with all 12 development steps (including Context Compactor and Incident Management)
- ✅ **Implements advanced AI collaboration techniques** including expert personas and context engineering
- ✅ **Includes iterative refinement capabilities** with evaluation testing
- ✅ **Avoids common pitfalls** from manual integration experiences
- ✅ **Provides clear guidance** for team adoption and persona-based prompting

## Phase 1: Repository Analysis

### Examine Repository Structure
Use `@workspace` to analyze:
- **Project Type**: Single project, Nx monorepo, Lerna monorepo, or custom monorepo?
- **Applications**: What applications/packages exist and where?
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, cloud providers, testing tools
- **Existing Files**: Any current AI development tools or conflicting files?
- **External Tool Artifacts**: Detect pre-existing specifications from external tools

### Technology Detection Patterns
Look for these indicators:
- **Languages**: TypeScript (tsconfig.json), Python (requirements.txt), JavaScript (package.json)
- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, Express, FastAPI, Next.js, Vite
- **Cloud**: AWS SDK, Azure SDK, GCP SDK in dependencies
- **Testing**: Jest, Pytest, Vitest, Cypress configurations
- **Build Tools**: Nx (nx.json), Webpack, Vite, Rollup configurations

### External Tool Artifact Detection
Scan for existing specification artifacts:
- **Kiro Artifacts**: `design.md`, `requirements.md`, `tasks.md` files
- **Spec Kit Artifacts**: `specs/[###-feature-name]/` directories containing:
  - `spec.md`: Core feature specifications
  - `plan.md`: Implementation plans
  - `tasks.md`: Task breakdowns
  - `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`: Supporting documents
- **Nested Specs**: Look for a specs directory containing subdirectories, each with `design.md`, `requirements.md`, etc. If this pattern is found, it indicates the project manages multiple specification sets.
- **Generic Documentation**: Any `.md` files with requirements, specifications, or design content
- **Legacy Planning**: Existing documentation that could serve as specification sources

### Architecture Decision Logic
```
Is this a monorepo?
├── Single Project → Use Repository-Focused approach
└── Monorepo → 
    ├── Multiple independent applications? → Use Application-Focused (recommended)
    ├── Shared codebase with single deployable? → Use Repository-Focused  
    └── Mixed/complex? → Ask for clarification
```

## Phase 2: Implementation Strategy

### Repository-Focused (Single Project or Unified Monorepo)
- Create `.ai-dev/` at repository root with complete workflow (12 agents including Compactor and Incident Management)
- Add `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project context and expert persona guidance
- Generate 12 traditional agent prompts + 12 GitHub Copilot prompts with expert personas
- Create `AIDEV.md` for development history with plan-centric philosophy
- Include advanced context engineering and evaluation testing capabilities

### Application-Focused (Independent Applications Monorepo)
- Create complete `.ai-dev/` instance per application (12 agents each)
- Add `.github/prompts/` with 12 workflow prompts per application including expert personas
- Repository-level `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for governance and advanced techniques
- Application-level `AIDEV.md` files for development history
- Minimal operational documentation in `docs/` with persona-based prompting guidance

## Phase 3: File Creation with Real Context

### Extract Project Variables
From actual repository files, extract:
- **PROJECT_NAME**: From package.json name or repository directory
- **ARCHITECTURE_STYLE**: Based on detected patterns (e.g., "Microservices with AWS", "React SPA", "Python API")
- **PRIMARY_LANGUAGE**: Most prevalent language in codebase
- **FRAMEWORKS**: Key frameworks detected from dependencies
- **CLOUD_PROVIDER**: AWS/Azure/GCP from SDK dependencies
- **TESTING_FRAMEWORK**: Jest/Pytest/etc from configurations
- **SHARED_LIBRARIES**: Internal import patterns
- **EXPERT_DOMAINS**: Relevant expert personas for the technology stack (e.g., Martin Fowler for enterprise apps, John Carmack for performance-critical code)

### External Tool Artifact Integration
When external tool artifacts are detected, integrate them appropriately:

**Kiro Integration**:
- Move `design.md`, `requirements.md`, `tasks.md` to `.ai-dev/memory/` for processing
- Keep copies in `docs/` directory for permanent reference
- Create consolidation workflow that analyzes and merges documents
- Initialize AIDEV.md with reference to Kiro-generated foundation

**Spec Kit Integration**:
- Preserve `specs/[###-feature-name]/` directory structure for reference
- Copy `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` to `.ai-dev/memory/` for immediate use
- Move supporting documents (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`) to memory
- Enable direct task execution workflow since planning is pre-completed
- Initialize AIDEV.md acknowledging Spec Kit foundation and constitution-based planning

**Hybrid Workflows**:
- Support projects using multiple specification sources
- Prioritize most recent/comprehensive specifications
- Document the integration approach in team guidance

### Customize Agent Prompts with Expert Personas
Tailor the 12 workflow prompts for detected technology and include appropriate expert personas:
- **00-specification-agent.md**: Eric Evans/Martin Fowler personas for domain-driven specifications
- **01-planner-agent.md**: Grady Booch/Kent Beck personas with context engineering phases
- **02-estimator-agent.md**: Steve McConnell persona for evidence-based estimation
- **03-coder-agent.md**: John Carmack/Kent Beck personas based on performance vs. simplicity needs
- **04-tester-agent.md**: James Bach/Kent Beck personas with evaluation tests (evals)
- **05-refactor-agent.md**: Martin Fowler persona for systematic refactoring
- **06-documenter-agent.md**: Richard Feynman persona for clear explanations
- **07-security-reviewer-agent.md**: Penetration tester persona for vulnerability discovery
- **08-archiver-agent.md**: Enhanced with plan-centric philosophy and context engineering notes
- **09-compactor-agent.md**: Advanced context management and conversation distillation
- **10-incident-triage-agent.md**: SRE persona for systematic production issue diagnosis
- **11-incident-fix-agent.md**: Principal Engineer persona for balanced incident response

### GitHub Copilot Integration
Create repository and/or application-level GitHub Copilot configurations:
- **copilot-instructions.md**: Real project context, development guidelines, and expert persona guidance
- **10 prompt files**: Quick workflow alternatives to traditional agents with expert personas
- **Advanced techniques documentation**: References to context engineering and persona-based prompting
- **Consistent naming**: Use detected project patterns
