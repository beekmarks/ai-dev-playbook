# Write Tests

Your goal is to create comprehensive tests for a specific piece of code or functionality.

## Requirements

- Write tests that verify the code works as expected
- Cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Ensure tests are readable and maintainable
- Follow testing best practices for the language/framework

## Guidelines

- Use the project's preferred testing framework
- Write tests that are isolated and don't depend on external services when possible
- Include setup and teardown code as needed
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Consider test coverage for:
  - Normal operation
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
  - Performance considerations (if applicable)

## Output Format

1. Brief overview of what you're testing
2. Test strategy and approach
3. The actual test code with appropriate assertions
4. Any notes on test coverage or areas that might need additional testing
