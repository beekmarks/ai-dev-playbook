# Plan Feature

Your goal is to create a detailed implementation plan for a new feature or task using advanced context engineering principles.

## Context Engineering Approach

**Phase 1: Context Gathering**
- Identify all information sources needed for planning
- Gather requirements, related code, architecture docs, and constraints
- Collect examples of similar implementations or patterns
- Identify dependencies and integration points

**Phase 2: Context Filtering and Planning**
- Filter gathered context to focus on directly relevant information
- Create a structured plan based on filtered context
- Include context management strategy for implementation phase

## Requirements

Break down the feature request into clear, actionable technical steps that a developer can follow. Focus on:

- Creating a logical sequence of implementation steps
- Identifying dependencies between components
- Highlighting potential technical challenges
- Considering edge cases and error handling
- Managing context effectively throughout implementation

## Guidelines

- Use specifications as the primary source of truth when available
- Ensure your plan aligns with requirements and design decisions in the specifications
- Do not write any actual code
- Be specific about file locations and naming
- Consider the existing architecture and patterns
- Include steps for testing and validation
- Identify any security considerations
- Include a "Context Management" section identifying what information should be preserved for implementation

## Output Format

Provide your plan as a numbered list of steps, with each step containing:
1. A clear, concise title
2. A detailed description of what needs to be done
3. Any technical considerations or potential challenges
4. Dependencies on other steps (if applicable)

Include these additional sections:
- **Context Summary**: Key information that will be needed during implementation
- **Overall Approach**: Summary of the strategy and key decisions
- **Context Handoff**: What context should be preserved for the next phase
