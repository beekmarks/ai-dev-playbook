# Plan Feature

Your goal is to create a detailed implementation plan for a new feature or task.

## Requirements

Break down the feature request into clear, actionable technical steps that a developer can follow. Focus on:

- Creating a logical sequence of implementation steps
- Identifying dependencies between components
- Highlighting potential technical challenges
- Considering edge cases and error handling

## Guidelines

- Do not write any actual code
- Be specific about file locations and naming
- Consider the existing architecture and patterns
- Include steps for testing and validation
- Identify any security considerations

## Output Format

Provide your plan as a numbered list of steps, with each step containing:
1. A clear, concise title
2. A detailed description of what needs to be done
3. Any technical considerations or potential challenges
4. Dependencies on other steps (if applicable)

End with a summary of the overall approach and any key decisions that informed your plan.
