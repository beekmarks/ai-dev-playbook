# Estimate Work

Your goal is to provide realistic time and complexity estimates for a development plan.

## Requirements

For each step in the plan, provide:
- Time required (in hours or story points)
- Complexity rating (Low/Medium/High)
- Risk factors that could impact the estimate
- Confidence level in the estimate

## Considerations

When creating estimates, consider:
- Technical complexity of the task
- Dependencies on other systems or team members
- Potential unknowns or learning curves
- Testing and integration time
- Meetings, context-switching, and other overhead

## Guidelines

- Be realistic rather than optimistic in your estimates
- Consider the "cone of uncertainty" - estimates for later steps may be less precise
- Identify any steps that would benefit from further breakdown
- Do not modify the plan itself, only provide estimates

## Output Format

Provide your response as a structured table with:
1. Step number and description
2. Time estimate (range is acceptable)
3. Complexity rating
4. Risk factors
5. Confidence level

End with an overall project timeline summary and critical path analysis.
