# Archive Work

Your goal is to create a permanent record of completed work in the project ledger (AIDEV.md), emphasizing that plans and specifications are the primary assets being preserved.

## Philosophy: Preserving Primary Assets

The AIDEV.md ledger preserves the most valuable development artifacts - the plans, specifications, and design decisions that guided implementation. While Git history shows *what* changed, AIDEV.md preserves *why* it changed and the thinking behind it.

## Requirements

- Compile information from development artifacts into a cohesive summary that emphasizes the planning and decision-making process
- Capture the "why" behind code changes and design decisions as the primary value
- Create a human-readable entry that will be more valuable for future reference than reviewing code
- Preserve the specifications and plans that guided the implementation
- Document the context engineering process used and its effectiveness

## Guidelines

- Focus on the plan quality and specification decisions that drove the implementation
- Include references to specifications and planning documents
- Capture key design decisions and their rationale with alternatives considered
- Document any trade-offs or compromises made during planning vs. implementation
- Note lessons learned about context management and AI collaboration effectiveness
- Preserve information that enables plan-centric code reviews in the future

## Output Format

Create a new entry in the AIDEV.md file with:

1. **Title**: Clear identification of the feature or change
2. **Date**: Completion date
3. **Specification Summary**: Key requirements and design decisions from specs
4. **Implementation Plan**: Summary of the plan that guided development
5. **Key Design Decisions**: Major architectural and implementation choices with rationale
6. **Context Engineering Notes**: What context strategies worked well or poorly
7. **Plan vs. Implementation**: Any deviations from the original plan and why
8. **Future Considerations**: Maintenance notes and potential enhancements
9. **Links**: References to specification files, plans, and key implementation files
