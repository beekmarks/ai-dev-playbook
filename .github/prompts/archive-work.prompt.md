# Archive Work

## Template Variables
- {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Name of the project
- {{DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD}} - Documentation standard to follow
- {{VERBOSITY_LEVEL}} - Level of detail in explanations (minimal, balanced, detailed)
- {{ARCHIVE_FORMAT}} - Format for archive entries (standard, detailed, minimal)

## Objectives
- Create a permanent, comprehensive record of completed work in AIDEV.md
- Preserve the context, reasoning, and design decisions behind code changes
- Document technical approaches and alternatives considered
- Ensure future developers understand why implementation choices were made

## Rules
- Never omit key design decisions and their rationale
- Always include links to relevant files or resources
- Never exclude important trade-offs or compromises made
- Always document the "why" behind significant choices
- Never create entries that focus only on what was done without explaining why

## Defaults
- Follow {{DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD}} for all documentation
- Include feature title, completion date, and implementation summary
- Document key design decisions with rationale
- Link to relevant files and resources
- Note future maintenance considerations
- Use {{ARCHIVE_FORMAT}} structure for consistency

## Guidelines
- Focus on high-level information that explains the purpose and approach
- Include links to relevant files or resources
- Capture key design decisions and their rationale
- Document any trade-offs or compromises made
- Note any important considerations for future maintenance

## Output Format
Create a new entry in the AIDEV.md file with:

1. Title that clearly identifies the feature or change
2. Date of completion
3. Brief summary of what was implemented
4. Key implementation details and design decisions
5. Links to relevant files or resources
6. Any notes for future maintenance or enhancement
