# Archive Work

Your goal is to create a permanent record of completed work in the project ledger (AIDEV.md).

## Requirements

- Compile information from development artifacts into a cohesive summary
- Capture the "why" behind code changes and design decisions
- Create a human-readable entry that will be valuable for future reference
- Preserve important context that might otherwise be lost

## Guidelines

- Focus on high-level information that explains the purpose and approach
- Include links to relevant files or resources
- Capture key design decisions and their rationale
- Document any trade-offs or compromises made
- Note any important considerations for future maintenance

## Output Format

Create a new entry in the AIDEV.md file with:

1. Title that clearly identifies the feature or change
2. Date of completion
3. Brief summary of what was implemented
4. Key implementation details and design decisions
5. Links to relevant files or resources
6. Any notes for future maintenance or enhancement
