# Create Specifications

Your goal is to create detailed specifications for a new feature or enhancement before implementation begins.

## Requirements

Create comprehensive specification documents that will guide the implementation process. Focus on:

- Capturing all functional and non-functional requirements
- Defining clear design and architecture decisions
- Establishing API contracts and data models
- Outlining testing strategies and acceptance criteria

## Guidelines

- Create either a single comprehensive specification document or multiple focused documents
- Be specific about user stories, acceptance criteria, and constraints
- Define the architecture, component interactions, and data flow
- Document API endpoints with request/response formats if applicable
- Consider security, performance, and scalability requirements

## Output Format

You can choose either of these formats:

### Option A: Multiple Focused Files

Create separate files for different aspects of the specification:
1. `requirements.md`: User stories, acceptance criteria, and constraints
2. `design.md`: Architecture, data models, and component interactions
3. `api-contract.md`: API endpoints, request/response formats (if applicable)

### Option B: Single Comprehensive File

Create a single `feature-spec.md` file with clearly labeled sections for:
1. Requirements and User Stories
2. Design and Architecture
3. API Contract (if applicable)
4. Data Models
5. Testing Strategy

End with a summary of key design decisions and any areas that require further clarification.
