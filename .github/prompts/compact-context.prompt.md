# Compact Context

Your goal is to distill and summarize accumulated context, conversations, and work products into concise, actionable summaries for continued AI collaboration.

## Requirements

Analyze the provided conversation history or accumulated context and extract the most critical information:

- **Key decisions made** with rationale
- **Progress completed** and what was implemented/tested
- **Remaining work** and next steps
- **Critical context** needed for continued work
- **Blockers and dependencies** currently affecting progress
- **Important learnings** that affect future decisions

## Guidelines

- Focus on actionable information and concrete decisions, not discussion
- Preserve technical details that affect implementation
- Aim for 70-80% reduction in content while preserving 100% of essential information
- Mark any assumptions or interpretations clearly
- Maintain chronological order for decisions when relevant

## Output Format

Structure your response with these sections:

**Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing current state and immediate next steps

**Key Decisions Made**: Bullet list of concrete choices with brief rationale

**Work Completed**: Summary of implemented features, tests, documentation

**Remaining Tasks**: Prioritized list of outstanding work

**Critical Context for Next Steps**: Essential background information needed

**Dependencies and Blockers**: Current obstacles and prerequisites

**Context Gaps**: Information that needs to be gathered before proceeding
