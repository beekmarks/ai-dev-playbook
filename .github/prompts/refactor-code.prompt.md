# Refactor Code

Your goal is to improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of existing code without changing its functionality.

## Requirements

- Identify areas where the code can be improved
- Maintain the same functionality and behavior
- Improve readability, performance, or maintainability
- Follow the project's coding style and patterns

## Focus Areas

Look for opportunities to:
- Remove code duplication
- Improve naming of variables, functions, and classes
- Extract reusable functions or methods
- Simplify complex logic
- Improve error handling
- Enhance performance (if applicable)
- Add or improve comments where needed

## Guidelines

- Make incremental changes that can be easily reviewed
- Explain the rationale behind each refactoring decision
- Consider the impact on testing and ensure refactored code remains testable
- Do not introduce new features or change existing behavior

## Output Format

1. Brief summary of the refactoring goals
2. List of specific refactoring changes with rationale
3. The refactored code with language-specific formatting
4. Any notes on potential impacts or considerations
