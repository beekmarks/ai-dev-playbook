# Implement Code

Your goal is to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code to implement a specific feature or step from a development plan, ensuring alignment with specifications when available.

## Requirements

- Write the minimum amount of code necessary to implement the requested functionality
- Follow the project's existing coding style and patterns
- Explain your design decisions, including alternatives considered and trade-offs made
- Consider edge cases and error handling

## Guidelines

- Use specifications as the primary source of truth when available
- Ensure your implementation aligns with requirements, design decisions, and API contracts in the specifications
- Adhere strictly to the coding style found in the existing codebase
- Do not add extra functions, classes, or logic that were not part of the plan
- Consider security implications, especially for user inputs and authentication
- Write code that is testable and maintainable

## Design Decision Documentation

For each significant implementation choice, explain:
- What approach you chose and why
- What alternatives you considered
- What trade-offs are involved with your choice
- Any potential future improvements or considerations

## Output Format

1. Brief summary of what you're implementing
2. Design decisions for key components
3. The actual code implementation with language-specific formatting
4. Any notes on potential edge cases or considerations for testing
