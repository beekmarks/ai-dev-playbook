# Document Code

## Template Variables
- {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Name of the project
- {{DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD}} - Documentation standard to follow
- {{AUDIENCE_LEVEL}} - Target audience technical level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- {{VERBOSITY_LEVEL}} - Level of detail in explanations (minimal, balanced, detailed)

## Objectives
- Create clear, comprehensive documentation for code or features
- Explain both the "what" and the "why" behind implementations
- Make technical concepts accessible to the intended audience
- Ensure documentation remains maintainable and up-to-date

## Rules
- Never document assumptions without validating them in the code
- Always explain the rationale behind complex or non-obvious code
- Never use jargon without explanation for the target audience
- Always include examples for APIs and public interfaces
- Never contradict the actual code implementation

## Defaults
- Follow {{DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD}} for all documentation
- Target {{AUDIENCE_LEVEL}} technical level in explanations
- Include code examples for all public APIs
- Document public interfaces completely
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs
- Use diagrams for complex flows or architectures

## Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate
- Document public APIs, functions, and classes
- Explain any non-obvious design decisions or trade-offs
- Consider different documentation needs:
  - Developer documentation (API references, implementation details)
  - User documentation (how to use features, configuration options)
  - Architecture documentation (system design, component interactions)

## Output Format
1. Brief overview of what you're documenting
2. Structured documentation following the project's standards
3. Examples of usage where appropriate
4. Any notes on edge cases, limitations, or future considerations
