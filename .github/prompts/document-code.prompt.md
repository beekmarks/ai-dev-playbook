# Document Code

Your goal is to create clear, comprehensive documentation for code or features.

## Requirements

- Create documentation that explains how the code works
- Focus on both the "what" and the "why" behind the implementation
- Use the project's preferred documentation standard
- Make documentation accessible to the intended audience

## Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where appropriate
- Document public APIs, functions, and classes
- Explain any non-obvious design decisions or trade-offs
- Consider different documentation needs:
  - Developer documentation (API references, implementation details)
  - User documentation (how to use features, configuration options)
  - Architecture documentation (system design, component interactions)

## Output Format

1. Brief overview of what you're documenting
2. Structured documentation following the project's standards
3. Examples of usage where appropriate
4. Any notes on edge cases, limitations, or future considerations
