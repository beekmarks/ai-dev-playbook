- Assume the code was written with good intentions
- Prioritize feedback on issues that could cause bugs or maintenance problems
- Suggest improvements in order of importance
- Provide concrete examples for suggested changes
- Use {{CODING_STYLE}} as the reference for style recommendations
- Consider {{ERROR_HANDLING_STRATEGY}} when reviewing error handling
- Reference {{DOCUMENTATION_STANDARD}} for documentation suggestions
