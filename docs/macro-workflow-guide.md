# Macro-Workflow Guide: Autonomous Goal-Oriented Development

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing the **Macro-Workflow** - the AI Dev Playbook's approach to managing large, complex projects using autonomous agents while maintaining human strategic control and governance.

## Overview

The Macro-Workflow represents the highest level of AI-assisted development, designed for:
- **Complex Jira tickets or GitHub issues**
- **System-wide refactoring or framework migrations**
- **Multi-component feature implementations**
- **Performance optimization projects**
- **Security vulnerability remediation**

This workflow leverages autonomous agents (Devin-style) while maintaining the playbook's core principles of human oversight, security, and comprehensive documentation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Strategic Human Direction
- **Developer as Director**: Human sets high-level goals and strategic constraints
- **Plan Validation**: Human approves strategic approach before execution
- **Continuous Oversight**: Human monitors progress and can intervene at any time

### 2. Defensive Prompting
- **Clear Objectives**: Unambiguous definition of goals and success criteria
- **Explicit Constraints**: Architectural patterns, libraries, performance requirements
- **Context Provision**: Precise information needed for successful execution
- **Strategic Guidance**: High-level approach and decision-making framework

### 3. Comprehensive Governance
- **Secure Execution**: All code execution in sandboxed environments
- **Audit Trails**: Complete documentation of decisions and changes
- **Quality Gates**: Multiple validation checkpoints throughout process
- **Risk Management**: Proactive identification and mitigation of risks

## Macro-Workflow Process

### Stage 1: Goal Analysis and Strategic Planning

#### Step 1.1: Goal Intake and Analysis
**Human Responsibilities:**
- Provide high-level goal (ticket, issue, or natural language description)
- Define success criteria and acceptance criteria
- Identify key stakeholders and constraints
- Set timeline and priority expectations

**AI Agent Responsibilities:**
- Parse and analyze the high-level objective
- Identify ambiguities requiring clarification
- Research relevant codebase context and dependencies
- Generate initial understanding and questions

**Example Goal Intake:**
```markdown
