## Updated Workflows

### **Traditional Workflow (v1.0) - Still Supported**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Human] --> B[Specification Agent]
    B --> C[Planner Agent]
    C --> D[Coder Agent]
    D --> E[Tester Agent]
    E --> F[Security Reviewer]
    F --> G[Archiver Agent]
```

**Usage**: Continue using individual agents for discrete, well-defined tasks.

### **Enhanced Workflow (v2.0) - Recommended**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[High-Level Goal] --> B[Delegator Agent]
    B --> C[Strategic Planning]
    C --> D[Human Approval]
    D --> E[Agent Swarm Orchestration]
    E --> F[AI Code Review]
    F --> G[Quality Validation]
    G --> H[Final Delivery]
```

**Usage**: Use for complex, multi-phase projects requiring strategic coordination.

### **Hybrid Workflow (v2.0) - Flexible**

Combine traditional and enhanced approaches:
- Use **individual agents** for quick, focused tasks
- Use **Delegator Agent** for complex project coordination
- Use **AI Code Review** for all code changes
- Use **automation scripts** to reduce manual overhead

## End-to-End Example

Let's walk through a complete example: **"Implement a user authentication system with OAuth 2.0 integration"**

### **v1.0 Approach (Manual Orchestration)**

```bash
# Step 1: Create specifications
# Manually invoke Specification Agent with requirements

# Step 2: Create implementation plan
# Manually invoke Planner Agent with specifications

# Step 3: Implement code
# Manually invoke Coder Agent with plan

# Step 4: Create tests
# Manually invoke Tester Agent with implementation

# Step 5: Security review
# Manually invoke Security Reviewer Agent

# Step 6: Document and archive
# Manually invoke Documenter and Archiver agents
```

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours of manual coordination
**Human Overhead**: High - constant context switching and agent management

### **v2.0 Approach (Orchestrated Agent Swarm)**

#### **Step 1: Initialize Orchestration**
```bash
./ai-dev/scripts/delegator-orchestrator.sh start "Implement user authentication system with OAuth 2.0 integration, including Google and GitHub providers, secure session management, and comprehensive testing"
```

**Output**:
```

## Advanced Features

### **Multi-Project Orchestration**

Use the Delegator Agent for coordinating multiple related projects:

```bash
# Complex system migration
./ai-dev/scripts/delegator-orchestrator.sh start "Migrate monolithic application to microservices architecture with zero downtime, including database migration, API gateway setup, and monitoring implementation"
```

### **Continuous Code Review Integration**

Integrate AI-powered code review with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
name: AI Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run AI Code Review
        run: |
          ./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}..${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} pull-request
```

### **Custom Agent Configurations**

Customize agents for specific project needs:

```bash
# Security-focused review
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review staged security-review

# Performance-focused review
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review HEAD~3..HEAD performance-review
```

### **Quality Gates and Metrics**

Implement automated quality gates based on AI review results:

```bash
# Example quality gate script
#!/bin/bash
REVIEW_OUTPUT="$1"
QUALITY_THRESHOLD=8
SECURITY_THRESHOLD=9

# Parse AI review scores and enforce thresholds
# Fail build if quality standards not met
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Migration Issues**

#### **Issue**: Scripts not executable
**Solution**:
```bash
chmod +x ai-dev/scripts/*.sh
```
