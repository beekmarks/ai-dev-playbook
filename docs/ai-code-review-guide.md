2. **Git Repository**: Active Git repository with commit history
3. **AI Development Environment**: Access to AI models for code analysis
4. **Secure Environment**: Sandbox capabilities for safe code analysis

### Installation and Setup

#### Step 1: Verify Code Review Agent

Ensure the AI-Powered Code Review Agent is available:

```bash
# Check if the agent prompt exists
ls -la ai-dev/prompts/09-code-review-agent.md

# Verify automation script
ls -la ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Review Environment

```bash
# Check automation script functionality
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh help

# View current status
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh status
```

#### Step 3: Setup Git Hooks (Optional)

For automated review integration:

```bash
# Install Git hooks for automatic review triggers
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh setup-hooks
```

This installs:
- **Pre-commit hook**: Generates review context for staged changes
- **Post-commit hook**: Creates review context for committed changes

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Pre-Commit Review

Review staged changes before committing:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Generate review context for staged changes
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review staged pre-commit
```

**Use Cases:**
- Quality validation before commit
- Security check for sensitive changes
- Compliance verification
- Best practices enforcement

### 2. Commit Review

Review a specific commit after it's been made:

```bash
# Review the latest commit
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review HEAD commit

# Review a specific commit
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review abc1234 commit
```

**Use Cases:**
- Post-commit quality assessment
- Security audit of recent changes
- Performance impact analysis
- Documentation validation

### 3. Pull Request Review

Comprehensive review of a feature branch or PR:

```bash
# Review changes from main to feature branch
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review main..feature-branch pull-request

# Review last 5 commits as a cohesive change
./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review HEAD~5..HEAD pull-request
```

**Use Cases:**
- Feature completeness validation
- Integration impact assessment
- Comprehensive security review
- Architecture compliance checking

### 4. Continuous Integration Review

Integration with CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: AI Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run AI Code Review
        run: |
          ./ai-dev/scripts/code-review-automation.sh review ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}..${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} pull-request
```

## AI Review Execution

### Step-by-Step Review Process

#### Step 1: Generate Review Context

The automation script creates comprehensive context including:
- **Change Analysis**: Files modified, lines changed, diff statistics

- **Review Instructions**: Specific guidance for the AI agent

#### Step 2: Load AI Code Review Agent

1. **Open AI Development Environment** (VS Code with AI extension, Claude, etc.)
2. **Load Agent Prompt**: Use `ai-dev/prompts/09-code-review-agent.md`
3. **Provide Context**: Share the generated review context file
4. **Execute Review**: Let the AI agent perform comprehensive analysis

#### Step 3: Review AI Output

The AI agent generates structured output including:
- **Executive Summary**: High-level assessment and recommendations
- **Detailed Analysis**: Comprehensive findings by category
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized action items
- **Quality Metrics**: Quantitative assessment scores

#### Step 4: Process Recommendations

1. **Address Critical Issues**: Fix blocking problems immediately
2. **Plan High-Priority Items**: Schedule important improvements
3. **Consider Optimizations**: Evaluate suggested enhancements
4. **Update Documentation**: Implement documentation recommendations

#### Step 5: Update AIDEV.md

Integrate review results into the development log:
- Use the generated AIDEV entry template
- Customize with actual AI review findings
- Document lessons learned and decisions made

#### Quality Gates Integration

Implement quality gates based on AI review results:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quality gate script example

REVIEW_OUTPUT="$1"
QUALITY_THRESHOLD=7
SECURITY_THRESHOLD=8

# Parse AI review output (implementation would parse actual AI output)
QUALITY_SCORE=$(grep "Code Quality Score" "$REVIEW_OUTPUT" | grep -o '[0-9]\+')
SECURITY_SCORE=$(grep "Security Score" "$REVIEW_OUTPUT" | grep -o '[0-9]\+')

if [[ $QUALITY_SCORE -lt $QUALITY_THRESHOLD ]] || [[ $SECURITY_SCORE -lt $SECURITY_THRESHOLD ]]; then
    echo "❌ Quality gate failed. Review and address issues before proceeding."
    exit 1
else
    echo "✅ Quality gate passed. Changes meet quality standards."
    exit 0
fi
```
