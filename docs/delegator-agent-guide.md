# Delegator Agent Guide: Orchestrating the AI Dev Playbook Agent Swarm

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for using the **Delegator Agent** - the meta-agent that orchestrates the specialized agent swarm to deliver autonomous, goal-oriented development while maintaining human strategic control and comprehensive governance.

## Overview

The Delegator Agent represents the ultimate evolution of the AI Dev Playbook, transforming it from a linear agent chain into a sophisticated agent swarm capable of handling complex, multi-phase projects autonomously while maintaining the highest standards of quality, security, and governance.

### Key Capabilities

- **Goal Analysis**: Parse complex, ambiguous objectives into clear requirements
- **Strategic Planning**: Design comprehensive implementation strategies with risk management
- **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate nine specialized agents for optimal task execution
- **Human Coordination**: Maintain strategic oversight with approval checkpoints
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all outputs meet governance and security standards
- **Knowledge Capture**: Generate comprehensive documentation and audit trails

## Architecture Overview

### Agent Swarm Structure

The Delegator Agent coordinates three specialized clusters:

#### **Planning Cluster**
- **Specification Agent (00)**: Requirements analysis and documentation
- **Planner Agent (01)**: Technical implementation planning  
- **Estimator Agent (02)**: Effort and complexity assessment

#### **Execution Cluster**
- **Coder Agent (03)**: Implementation and development
- **Refactorer Agent (05)**: Code quality and optimization
- **Tester Agent (04)**: Quality assurance and validation

#### **Quality Cluster**

```bash
# Example: Third-party integration
./ai-dev/scripts/delegator-orchestrator.sh start "Integrate with Salesforce CRM and implement bidirectional data synchronization"
```

**Key Focus Areas:**
- **API Analysis**: Understanding external system capabilities
- **Data Mapping**: Comprehensive field and entity mapping
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of integration failures
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Performance Optimization

For system-wide performance improvements:

```bash
# Example: Performance optimization
./ai-dev/scripts/delegator-orchestrator.sh start "Optimize application performance to handle 10x current load with sub-200ms response times"
```

**Optimization Strategy:**
- **Baseline Measurement**: Current performance metrics
- **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify performance constraints
- **Optimization Plan**: Database, caching, and code improvements
