# Starting a Project from Design Documents

This guide explains how to bootstrap a new AI Dev Playbook project when you already have design documents but no source code yet.

## Overview

Starting with design documents is an excellent approach that aligns perfectly with the AI Dev Playbook's Spec Driven Development methodology. You already have specifications - now we'll establish the AI Dev Playbook structure and use your existing documents to jump-start development.

## Quick Integration (Integration Assistant)

Use the Integration Assistant for the fastest, error‑free setup. It analyzes your repository, incorporates your existing design docs context, selects or confirms the correct integration pattern, scaffolds missing assets, and validates workflow readiness.

### Commands
Same repository (you started from this template):
```
@workspace Using the AI Dev Playbook Integration Assistant at integration-assistant.prompt.md, please analyze this repository and implement a complete AI Dev Playbook setup.
```
Adjacent clone (you created a fresh directory with only documents):
```
@workspace Using the AI Dev Playbook Integration Assistant at ../ai-dev-playbook/integration-assistant.prompt.md, please analyze this repository and implement a complete AI Dev Playbook setup.
```
Monorepo root (let assistant decide pattern):
```
@workspace Using the AI Dev Playbook Integration Assistant at ../ai-dev-playbook/integration-assistant.prompt.md, analyze this repository as a potential monorepo and implement the appropriate AI Dev Playbook integration pattern with a brief rationale.
```

### What It Automates
- Repository + document analysis (detects design/requirements/task files)
- Pattern selection (single project vs application-focused)
- Creation of .ai-dev/, .github/, AIDEV.md if absent
- Variable file scaffolding / merging
- Contextual linking of your existing docs into memory for first specification step
- Validation checklist output

### Manual Fallback
If the assistant is unavailable:
1. Clone ai-dev-playbook adjacent to your project
2. Copy .ai-dev/, .github/, and AIDEV.md into your repo root
3. Rename example.variables.json to variables.json and populate
4. Continue with the relevant Use Case section below

## Use Case 1: Starting from Kiro (design.md, requirements.md)

This workflow is for teams who use tools like Amazon's Kiro to generate initial design and requirements documents.

### Step 1: Create Your Project with AI Dev Playbook

**Option A: Use as Template (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone the AI Dev Playbook as your project foundation
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-dev-playbook.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name

# Reset git history for your new project
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup with AI Dev Playbook"
```

**Option B: Use Integration Assistant**
```bash
# Create empty project directory
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name

# Copy your design documents
cp /path/to/your/design.md .
cp /path/to/your/requirements.md .
cp /path/to/your/tasks.md .

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project with design documents"

# Download AI Dev Playbook adjacent to your project
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-dev-playbook.git

# Return to your project and integrate
cd your-project-name
code .
```

Then in VS Code, run the appropriate Integration Assistant command above.

### Step 2: Import Your Design Documents

**Move your documents to the AI Dev Playbook structure:**
```bash
# Move documents to the memory directory for processing
mv design.md .ai-dev/memory/
mv requirements.md .ai-dev/memory/
mv tasks.md .ai-dev/memory/

# Keep copies in your docs directory for reference
cp .ai-dev/memory/design.md docs/
cp .ai-dev/memory/requirements.md docs/
cp .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md docs/
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your AIDEV.md

Create an initial entry that references your existing documents:

```markdown
# AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)

This file tracks the development history of [Your Project Name] using the AI Dev Playbook methodology.

## Project Initialization from Kiro Design Documents - [Current Date]

### Description
Project bootstrapped from existing design documents (design.md, requirements.md, tasks.md) generated by Amazon's Kiro tool and integrated with the AI Dev Playbook methodology. This project will follow Spec Driven Development principles for all implementation work.

### Initial Documents
- **Requirements**: Comprehensive requirements in .ai-dev/memory/requirements.md
- **Design**: System design and architecture in .ai-dev/memory/design.md  
- **Tasks**: Initial task breakdown in .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md

### Next Steps
1. Review and consolidate design documents into formal specifications
2. Create detailed implementation plan based on existing tasks
3. Set up project structure and development environment
4. Begin iterative implementation using AI Dev Playbook workflow

### Project Context
- **Technology Stack**: [To be determined based on design requirements]
- **Architecture**: [Based on design.md specifications]
- **Development Methodology**: AI Dev Playbook with Spec Driven Development
```

## Use Case 2: Starting from Spec Kit Artifacts

This workflow is for teams leveraging the **Spec Kit project** to generate a comprehensive set of initial planning and design artifacts. Spec Kit produces a structured `specs` directory containing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and other valuable documents.

### Step 1: Generate Artifacts with Spec Kit

First, use the Spec Kit CLI to generate the initial project structure and specification documents. This will typically create a `specs/[###-feature-name]/` directory containing:

- **spec.md**: The core feature specification
- **plan.md**: A detailed, constitution-aligned implementation plan
- **tasks.md**: A list of executable development tasks
- **Supporting documents** like `research.md`, `data-model.md`, and `contracts/`

```bash
# Install Spec Kit if not already available
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init my-new-project

# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-new-project

# Generate initial specification
/specify Build an application that helps organize photos in separate albums

# Create technical implementation plan
/plan The application uses Vite with minimal libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Images metadata stored in local SQLite database.

# Generate task breakdown
/tasks
```

### Step 2: Integrate with AI Dev Playbook

Once you have your Spec Kit artifacts, integrate them into the AI Dev Playbook structure.

```bash
# Assume your project is 'my-new-project' and you've run Spec Kit
cd my-new-project

# Use the Integration Assistant for automated setup (recommended)
# In VS Code:
@workspace Using the AI Dev Playbook Integration Assistant at ../ai-dev-playbook/integration-assistant.prompt.md, please analyze this repository and implement a complete AI Dev Playbook setup.

# Or manually copy the AI Dev Playbook assets
# (Download ai-dev-playbook adjacent to your project first)
cp -r ../ai-dev-playbook/.ai-dev/ .
cp -r ../ai-dev-playbook/.github/ .
cp ../ai-dev-playbook/AIDEV.md .

# Move the generated specs into the .ai-dev/memory directory for processing
mv specs/[###-feature-name]/*.md .ai-dev/memory/
mv specs/[###-feature-name]/contracts .ai-dev/memory/

# Keep a copy in a 'specs' or 'docs' directory for permanent reference
mkdir -p specs
cp -r .ai-dev/memory/* specs/
```

### Step 3: Initialize Your AIDEV.md

Create an initial entry in your AIDEV.md file that references the artifacts generated by Spec Kit.

```markdown
# AI Development Log (AIDEV.md)

This file tracks the development history of [Your Project Name] using the AI Dev Playbook methodology.

## Project Initialization from Spec Kit Artifacts - [Current Date]

### Description
Project bootstrapped from artifacts generated by the Spec Kit project. This provides a strong foundation for Spec-Driven Development with constitution-aligned planning and structured task breakdown.

### Initial Artifacts
- **Specification**: Core requirements and user stories in `.ai-dev/memory/spec.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed technical plan in `.ai-dev/memory/plan.md`
- **Task List**: Granular development tasks in `.ai-dev/memory/tasks.md`
- **Supporting Documents**: Research, data models, and contracts in `.ai-dev/memory/`

### Next Steps
1. Review and validate the generated `plan.md` and `tasks.md`
2. Set up project structure and development environment based on the plan
3. Begin iterative implementation of tasks using the AI Dev Playbook Coder and Tester agents

### Project Context
- **Technology Stack**: [As defined in plan.md]
- **Architecture**: [Based on Spec Kit generated plan]
- **Development Methodology**: AI Dev Playbook with Spec Kit foundation
```

### Phase 2: Project Setup and Iterative Development

Because Spec Kit has already generated a detailed plan (`plan.md`) and task list (`tasks.md`), you can often bypass the initial Specification and Planner agent steps.

**1. Review the Plan**: Carefully review the generated `plan.md` in `.ai-dev/memory/` to ensure it aligns with your technical requirements.

**2. Execute Tasks**: Begin executing the steps outlined in `.ai-dev/memory/tasks.md` using the Coder Agent. Since the tasks are already defined, you can start implementation immediately.

```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Task T001 from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md.
```

**3. Follow the Workflow**: Continue with the standard AI Dev Playbook workflow (Test → Secure → Document → Archive) for each implemented task.

This approach allows you to leverage the rigorous, constitution-based planning of Spec Kit while using the flexible, agent-based execution model of the AI Dev Playbook.

## Workflow for Multiple Specification Sets

In a mature project, you will accumulate many sets of design documents. The `.ai-dev/memory/` directory is not intended for permanent storage. Instead, establish a dedicated, version-controlled directory (e.g., `specs/` or `docs/specs/`) within your project to store these artifacts permanently.

**When you begin a new task:**

1. **Identify the Specification Set**: Locate the directory containing the `design.md`, `requirements.md`, and `tasks.md` for the feature you are about to work on.

2. **Copy to Memory**: Copy these specific files into the `.ai-dev/memory/` directory. This acts as a staging area for the AI.

3. **Direct the AI**: Point the AI agents to the files now residing in `@workspace .ai-dev/memory/`.

4. **Archive and Clean**: Once the task is complete and archived in `AIDEV.md`, you can safely clear the contents of the `.ai-dev/memory/` directory.

This approach keeps your permanent documentation organized while ensuring the AI has a focused, uncluttered context for each individual task.

## Implementation Workflow

### For Kiro-Generated Documents (Use Case 1)

**Phase 1: Document Analysis and Consolidation**

**1. Analyze Your Existing Documents**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/00-specification-agent.md, analyze the design documents in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/ (design.md, requirements.md, tasks.md) and create a consolidated technical specification that includes:
- System requirements and constraints
- Architecture and design decisions
- API specifications and data models
- Technology stack recommendations
- Integration requirements
Save to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/consolidated-spec.md.
```

**2. Create Initial Implementation Plan**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, create a comprehensive implementation plan based on the consolidated specification in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/consolidated-spec.md and the task breakdown in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md. Organize work into phases:
1. Project setup and infrastructure
2. Core functionality implementation
3. Integration and testing
4. Documentation and deployment
Save to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/implementation-plan.md.
```

**3. Estimate Work and Complexity**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/02-estimator-agent.md, provide detailed time and complexity estimates for the implementation plan in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/implementation-plan.md. Consider:
- Technology stack setup time
- Development complexity by feature
- Testing and integration effort
- Documentation requirements
Save to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/project-estimates.md.
```

**Phase 2: Project Setup**

**1. Determine Technology Stack**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, based on the consolidated specification in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/consolidated-spec.md, recommend and set up the initial project structure including:
- Technology stack selection
- Project directory structure
- Build and dependency management setup
- Basic configuration files
- Development environment setup
```

**2. Create Project Foundation**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Phase 1 (Project setup and infrastructure) from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/implementation-plan.md. Focus on:
- Basic project structure
- Build system configuration
- Essential dependencies
- Development tooling setup
```

### For Spec Kit Artifacts (Use Case 2)

**Phase 1: Artifact Review and Validation**

Since Spec Kit provides constitution-aligned planning, you can often start directly with implementation:

**1. Review Generated Plan**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, review and validate the implementation plan in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/plan.md. Ensure it aligns with your project requirements and constraints. If modifications are needed, update the plan accordingly.
```

**2. Validate Task Breakdown**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/02-estimator-agent.md, review the task list in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md and provide time estimates for each task. Identify any dependencies or potential roadblocks.
```

**Phase 2: Direct Implementation**

Since Spec Kit has already done the heavy planning work, you can begin implementing tasks immediately:

**1. Execute Spec Kit Tasks**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Task T001 from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md as specified in the plan.
```

**2. Continue Sequential Implementation**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Task T002 from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/tasks.md, ensuring it builds on the previous task.
```

### Common Iterative Development (Both Use Cases)

**Phase 3: Iterative Development**

Now follow the standard AI Dev Playbook workflow for each feature/phase:

**For Each Development Phase:**

1. **Create Detailed Specifications** (if needed for Kiro workflows)
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/00-specification-agent.md, create detailed specifications for [specific feature] based on the requirements in @workspace .ai-dev/memory/consolidated-spec.md. Save to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/[feature-name]-spec.md.
```

2. **Plan Implementation** (if needed for Kiro workflows)
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/01-planner-agent.md, create implementation steps for [specific feature] based on @workspace .ai-dev/memory/[feature-name]-spec.md. Save to @workspace .ai-dev/memory/[feature-name]-plan.md.
```

3. **Implement Features**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/03-coder-agent.md, implement Step [X] from @workspace .ai-dev/memory/[feature-name]-plan.md.
```

4. **Write Tests**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/04-tester-agent.md, write comprehensive tests for the [feature] implementation including evaluation tests for quality measurement.
```

5. **Security Review**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/07-security-reviewer-agent.md, review the [feature] implementation for security concerns.
```

6. **Archive Progress**
```bash
Using @workspace ai-dev/prompts/08-archiver-agent.md, create an entry in @workspace AIDEV.md titled 'Feature: [Feature Name]' documenting the implementation.
```
